# Pinja 🥷📌

**Pinja** is a decentralized, censorship-resistant bookmarking app built on **Nostr**. It lets you **pin** (save) and organize links effortlessly while keeping full control over your data. No centralized servers, no surveillance—just pure, ninja-level bookmarking!

## 🏆 Features

- 📌 **Save & Tag Links** – Organize bookmarks with custom tags.
- 🔐 **Private & Public Bookmarks** – Encrypt your private pins, share public ones.
- 🔍 **Search & Filter** – Find bookmarks by keyword, tag, or date.
- ⚡ **Zap-Enabled** – Tip sats for valuable links using Lightning.
- 🛰 **Decentralized** – Uses Nostr relays, no central server required.
- 🔄 **Import/Export** – Move bookmarks between services easily.

## 🎯 How It Works

- Bookmarks are stored as **Nostr events**.
- Private bookmarks are **end-to-end encrypted**.
- Tags are attached using **event metadata**.
- Users can **subscribe to tag-based feeds** or follow friends’ bookmarks.
- Relays help distribute bookmarks but do **not own your data**.
