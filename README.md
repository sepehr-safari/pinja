**Pinja** is a modern social bookmarking platform built on the **Nostr** protocol, designed to help users collect, organize, and explore valuable content from across the web. Inspired by minimalist tools like Pinboard.in, Pinja makes it easy to save and share links, tag them for easy retrieval, and discover new content through a rich social experience. The platform emphasizes simplicity and speed, allowing users to quickly add bookmarks, categorize them with tags, and access them from any device.

With browser extensions, real-time feeds, advanced search, tag-based navigation, and support for RSS and APIs, Pinja focuses heavily on content discoverability. Users can follow each other, comment on shared links, and explore trending topics or curated collections, making it a powerful tool for knowledge sharing and community-driven discovery.

Everything on Pinja is public by default, promoting an open ecosystem where useful resources aren‚Äôt buried or siloed‚Äîthey‚Äôre searchable, linkable, and accessible to everyone. Whether you're saving research, curating tutorials, or just bookmarking great reads, Pinja helps you stay organized and connected.
